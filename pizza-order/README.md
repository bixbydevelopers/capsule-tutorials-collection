</p>

## Description

These capsules demonstrate how to capture multiple values into a single concept. These are companion capsules to the Bixby Tech Tip of the Week

There are 2 capsules
- Pizza Order 1 - simplest capsule, handles multiple values for a concept but values that are multiple words fail
- Pizza Order 2 - a refactor of the first capsule which now handles multiple word values for concepts

# Usage:

Open the simulator and run

 `start`

 and tell Bixby what pizza toppings you want
